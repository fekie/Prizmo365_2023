# Security Policy
To ensure that there are no vulnerabilities in this repository that could result in problems when users use these features, this section is open to provide a way for users to report any vulnerabilities that may be found.

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent release of Prizmo365 will be supported for vulnerability solutions. This is because the most recent release is published to squash bugs, add features, and improve upon previous code.
As such, while you can report issues found in previous releases, they are unlikely to be solved.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please refer to the [Bug Reports](https://github.com/kazumikascadia/Prizmo365_2023/tree/main#bug-reports) section of the README.md file. 
Since vulnerabilities will be counted as bug reports, they will likely be solved as soon as possible or even when they appear.

When you choose to report a vulnerability, be sure to provide specifically how you discovered this problem, where it is, and the release in which it appears. 
If you can provide possible solutions, they would be extremely appreciated.
