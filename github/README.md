# Prizmo 365
Prizmo is a work in progress Discord bot built with a multipurpose mindset. It is currently in a closed alpha build but should be released to the public within the coming months.

Best of all, Prizmo is completely free and entirely open-source. You can find all of Prizmoâ€™s code in this Github repository, and you are completely free to use all of it. Furthermore, once the bot is released, there are no current plans for monetization. Donations will, however, always be accepted, but are not currently open.



Prizmo365 - meant for 365 days a year usage.
